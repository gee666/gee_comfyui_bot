  Hi!
  We're going to generate pictures here.

  If you are new to SD, I'll give you a wise advice for the start
  for your first image choose Realistic Vision 3.0 - it's a cool realistic model, trained on photos <tg-spoiler>(it can make erotic pictures in case you want)</tg-spoiler>. But it barely can make art, it is made for photorealism.

  Use this text as negative prompt, in SD negative promt makes serious difference:

  <code>cloned face, poorly drawn face, extra arms, extra fingers, extra legs, extra limb, floating limbs, fused fingers, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, malformed hands, bad anatomy, bad proportions, gross proportions, long body, long neck, blurry, cropped, dehydrated, jpeg artifacts, low quality, low-res, out of frame, worst quality, deformed, disfigured, mutilated, mangled, unrealistic, duplicate, morbid, mutation, poorly drawn, signature, text, too many fingers, ugly, username, watermark, photoshop, airbrush, kitsch, oversaturated, disgusting, conjoined twins, meme, elongated, strabismus, heterochromia</code>

  Let's play, shall we?
